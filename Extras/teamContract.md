_This document describes our team social contract for this project_

- Roles
- Taskmaster
- Gitmaster
- Testmaster

- Daily process
- Morning standup at 10:45 a.m. EST
- Work individually on your assigned work and if any problems arises pair program on the problem.
- Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
- Bring up any blocking issues after 15 minutes of spinning your wheels
- At 6:00pm have re-group meeting where you check-in with blockers, status updates and plan for EOD merge
- Immediately prior to end of day make applicable PRs, review each other’s code and merge into master
- Everyone should meet near EOD to discuss what progress has been and what needs to be worked on similar to a Stand-Up.
- Make as frequent commit as possible.

- Team expectations
- Each of us reserves the rights to our nights and weekends, and we have all been straightforward about when and how we can commit to working on the project
- If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
- We will assign tasks vertically (instead of horizontally)
- None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
- Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
- Share the mic
- Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
- At least message the group when you change what you are working on.
- If nobody is available to troubleshoot
- If nobody knows the solution after troubleshooting for 15 minutes
- Process for troubleshooting:
- Rubber Ducking
- Re-writing more descriptive variables.

- Issues
- If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
- Take 10-15 minute break
- List out the pros / cons
- Vote on it
- If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
- If you are frustrated
- Take a walk or get some water
- Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
- Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrate.
